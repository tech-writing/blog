        <h2>What is Software Requirements Specification</h2>
        <p>
            <i>
                This article provides an intuition to build an understanding of what is a software requirements
                specification, and what are the benefits of having these documentation.
            </i>
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Overview and Benefits</h4>
        <p>
            The Software Requirements Specifications (SRS) is a specification for a particular software product,
            program, or set of programs that performs certain functions in a specific environment.

            Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications (IEEE Std 830-1998) highlights benefits that
            good SRS should provide for their customers, such as the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Establish the basis for agreement between parties involved in product creation on what the software
                product is to do
            </li>
            <li>Reduce the development effort </li>
            <li> Provide a basis for estimating costs and schedules </li>
            <li> Provide a baseline for validation and verification</li>
            <li> Facilitate transfer to new customers or include new parts of the organization </li>
            <li> Serve as a basis for enhancement </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            SRS should not describe any design or implementation details. These should be described in the design stage
            of the project. A requirement specifies an externally visible function or attribute of a system, while a
            design describes a particular subcomponent of a system or its interfaces with other subcomponents.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Outline of SRS</h4>

        <p>
            SRS outline, as suggested by Recommended Practice, looks like the following.

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h4>Introduction Section of SRS</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Introduction
                <ul>
                    <li>Purpose</li>
                    <li>Scope</li>
                    <li>Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations</li>
                    <li>References</li>
                    <li>Overview</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The “Purpose” defines the purpose and the intended audience for the SRS. “Scope” subsection identifies the
            software product to be produced by name, explains what the software product will and will not do, describes
            the application, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals.
            <br><br>
            “Definitions, acronyms and abbreviations” contains the definitions of all terms required to properly
            interpret the SRS. This information may be provided by reference to the appendixes in the SRS or by
            reference to other documents.
            <br><br>
            “References” subsection provides a complete list of all documents referenced elsewhere in the SRS. This
            information also may be provided by reference to an appendix or to another document.
            “Overview” describes what the rest of SRS contains and explains how the SRS is organized.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Overall Description Section</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Overall description
                <ul>
                    <li>Product perspective</li>
                    <li>Product functions</li>
                    <li>User characteristics</li>
                    <li>Constraints</li>
                    <li>Assumptions and dependencies</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            “Product perspective” puts the product into perspective with other related products. If the product is
            independent and totally self-contained, it should be so stated here.
            If the product is a component of a larger system, then this subsection should relate the requirements of
            that larger system to functionality of the software, and should identify interfaces between that system and
            the software.
            <br><br>
            “Product perspective” subsection also describes how the software operates inside various constraints. For
            example, these constraints may include system interfaces, user interfaces, hardware interfaces, software
            interfaces, communications interfaces, memory, operations, site adaptation requirements. More detailed
            description of the interfaces should be placed in the “Specific requirements” section where interfaces are
            being described.
            <br><br>
            “Product functions” provides a summary of the major functions of the software without mentioning the vast
            amount of detail that each of those functions requires. The functions should be organized in a way that
            makes the list of functions understandable to the customer or to anyone else reading the document for the
            first time. More detailed description of the functions should be placed in the “Functional requirements”
            subsection of the “Specific requirements” section.
            <br><br>
            “User characteristics” subsection describes general characteristics of the intended users of the product
            including, for example, age, gender, country of origin, educational level, experience, and technical
            expertise, etc.
            <br><br>
            “Constraints” includes a general description of any other items that will limit the developers’ options.
            These may include regulatory policies, hardware limitations, interfaces to other applications, parallel
            operations, audit and control functions, higher-order language requirements, signal handshake protocols,
            reliability requirements, criticality of the application, safety and security considerations.
            <br><br>
            “Assumptions and dependencies” describes the factors that affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These
            factors are not design constraints on the software but changes to them can affect
            the requirements in the SRS.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Specific Requirements Section</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Specific requirements
                <ul>
                    <li>External interface requirements</li>
                    <li>User interfaces</li>
                    <li>Hardware interfaces</li>
                    <li>Software interfaces</li>
                    <li>Communications interfaces</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Functional requirements</li>
                    <li>Performance requirements</li>
                    <li>Design constraints</li>
                    <li>Software system attributes</li>
                    <li>Other requirements</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This section of the SRS should contain all of the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to
            enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers to test that the system
            satisfies those requirements.
            <br><br>
            Interface descriptions (as compliment to “Product perspective” of Overall section) contain detailed
            descriptions of all inputs into and outputs from the software system.
            <br><br>
            “Functional requirements” defines the actions that must take place in the software to accept and process the
            inputs and to process and generate the outputs. These are generally listed
            as “shall” statements starting with “The system shall…”. These include validity checks on the inputs, exact
            sequence of operations, response to abnormal situations, effect of parameters.
            <br><br>
            “Performance requirements” specify both the static and the dynamic numerical requirements placed on the
            software or on human interaction with the software as a whole.
            <br>
            Static numerical requirements (also called “Capacity”) may include the number of terminals to be supported,
            the number of simultaneous users to be supported, amount and type of information to be handled.
            <br>
            Dynamic numerical requirements may include, for example, the numbers of transactions and tasks and the
            amount of data to be processed within certain time periods for both normal and peak workload conditions.
            <br>
            All of these requirements should be stated in measurable terms.
            <br><br>
            “Design constraints” specifies constraints that can be imposed by other standards, hardware limitations,
            etc.
            <br><br>
            Listing of “Software system attributes” may include reliability, availability, security, maintainability,
            portability, etc.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
            Recommended Practice for SRS provides key points, guides and insights to build intuition about SRS. As each
            software company has its own work specificity and culture it is a good start point to create your own
            corporate documentation framework that will fit your needs and projects. Potential benefits relate to
            implementing high standards, move from intuition to more professional ways of communication, and make
            projects more predictable and manageable.
