        <h2>What is Software, Platform, and Infrastructure as a Service</h2>
        <p><i>Understand and compare three most popular cloud computing service models - SaaS, PaaS, IaaS.</i></p>
        <br>

        <p>
            Traditionally companies and individuals consume hardware, software, and other IT assets by buying and
            installing them. In the “as a service” model cloud vendors own all assets and equipment and customers rent
            it with an on-demand approach.
        </p>

        <h4>Software as a Service (SaaS)</h4>
        <p>
            Idea of SaaS is to provide you software through your web browser as a user interface instead of downloading
            and installing the same software locally on your machine. For example, a well known text processor Microsoft
            Office can be installed locally on your computer. Alternatively, you can use Microsoft Office online with
            your browser as an interface. In this case a stable Internet connection is required.
            <br><br>
            At this model you pay monthly subscription instead of one time payment when you buy and download the
            software distributive. At the same time with SaaS you utilize less resources on your computer, as all data
            and calculations are related to the server side of the service provider. Also you don’t need to think about
            installing and configuring software on your computer.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h4>
        <p>
            PaaS and IaaS are mostly oriented on software engineers and require technical skills to utilize its
            functionality. PaaS aims to create a professional cloud environment for software engineers to effectively
            build, test, run, host, scale their applications. It includes all variety of services like operating
            systems, runtime, virtualization, middleware, servers, storage, and networking.
            <br><br>
            IaaS is focused on providing the solutions to serve IT backend infrastructure like physical and virtual
            servers, storage and networking. SaaS and IaaS are being offered by technology giants like Microsoft,
            Google, Amazon, IBM, etc.
            <br><br>
            Figure below illustrates responsibilities between cloud vendors and customers in the context of IaaS, PaaS
            and SaaS.
